The idea of Statiscal Independence

Two events are statistically independent if, when you know the outcome of one, that doesn't change your calculated probabilty for outcomes of the other.

Statistical independence with variables is when the association between A and B isn't significatnly different from what would be expected just by natural chance.

Statiscally independence is defined mathematically in terms of probability in several differnt but equivalent ways.

$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
P(A|B)
