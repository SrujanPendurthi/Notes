Good studies should employ random processes(random sampling and random assignment)
There will be natural variation or random error from group to group, due to the use of random sampling and random assignment

<b>Probability</b> is the measure of the variation due to a random phenomenon.
	Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood of any outcome whose success varies from time to time(or from person to person, or object to object, depending on the situation)
	Measures the natural variation
	Probability is unitless
	Probability is assigned on a numerical scale from 0 to 1

<u>Simple Random Sample</u>
A sample chosen in such a way that every individual had the same chance of being chosen as every other individual; and every pair had the same chance of being chosen as every other pair; etc.

This equivalent to the following two conditions:
	Equal likelihood: Every individual must have the same likelihood of being selected as any other
	Independence: The likelihood that an individual is selected must be independent of any prior selection(so, if person 'A' gets selected or if 'A' doesn't get selected, the likelihood of selecting 'B' should be the same either way).

Relative Frequency:
	P = (# of different ways the outcome occurs)/(# of total outcomes)
A general rule of thumb is that a population should at least 10 or 20 times the sample size in order for lack of replacement to not affect the independence too badly. This is large population.
