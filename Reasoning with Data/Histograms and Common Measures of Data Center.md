# Mean and Median
**Mean** is the mathematical average value of a dataset, found by summing all the values, then dividing by number of values

Benefits of Mean: Uses all data, easy, and stable for symmetric data

Drawbacks of Mean: Sensitive to Outliers, Misleading for Skewed Data, not for categorical data

$$Mean = \sum_{n=1}^n \frac{X_1 + X_2 + ...+ X_n} {N}$$

**Median** is the midpoint of a frequency distribution

Benefits of Median: Outlier Resistant, Good for ordinal data(ratings), better for skewed data, able to find on a graph

Drawbacks of Median: Only focuses on middle of data, tedious for large datasets, less stable especially for small sample sizes
# Histograms
**Histograms** are charts that plot the distribution of numeric variable's values as a series of bars, letting us see skews and frequency distributions easily
