**Key Features of a Good Study**:
	Sensitivity: low random variation
		Keep variation small enough so that the effect(if there is one) can be detected in the sample
	Validity: Trustworthy estimates and trustworthy predictions
		when a calculated estimate is used(like the mean), or when a mathematical model is used to make a prediction, they should be trustworthy
	Generalization: No bias(systematic error)
		Conduct the study in such a way that, whatever sort of effect or relationship was found in the sample, a similar effect or relationship can be reasonably generalized to hold in the population
	Causality: no lurking variables or confounding variables
		Conduct the study in such a way that, if a relationship was found between x and y, we can confidently say that the relationship is actually due to causation not merely correlational
		these are variables other than the explanaotry variable or the response variable that may be responsible for the observed relationship

Solution to Random Variation: use a reasonably large sample size and randomly select the sample

Untrustworthiness in predication or estimates: inspect data for influential outliers and declare their presence and their potential effect on the estimate or on the prediction; possibly remove them

Bias:
	Sampling bias: sample is not chosen randomly
	Instrument bias: measuring errors(even surveys)

Simple Random Sampling(eliminates sampling bias):
	Equal Likelihood: every individual must have the same likelihood of being selected as every other individual
	Independence: the likelihood that an individual is selected must be independent of any prior selection

Random Assignment(eliminates confounding variables):
	making the treatment groups as identical as possible within the limits of random variation, allowing conclusion of causality between explanatory and response

Placebo Control Group:
	Group that is given a 'non-active' treatment for proper comparison and to avoid the placebo effect

Double Blind:
	When the subjects in the study do not know which treatment they got(to avoid placebo effect), and the researchers directly interacting with the subjects do not know(to avoid unconscious bias by the researchers)

Sufficient Sample Size;
	Reduces the effects of chance variabilty
	Increases statistical significance
	**Statistical Significance**: When an effect seen in a study is probably real, rather than merely due to sampling variation

Observational Study:
	A study in which the subjects themselves decided which treatments to get without input from the researcher
	Characterizes by a lack of direct manipulation of the subjects, only the observation effect
	Still can generalize, but cannot say causal because no random assignment

Experimental Study
	A study in which the researcher plays the role in deciding which subjects get which treatments

Randomized Experimental Study:
	A study in which the researcher assigns the subjects to the treatment groups using random assignment
	Still can generalize and say casual
