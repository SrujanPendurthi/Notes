**Lasso** is a linear model that estimates sparse coefficients
	it is able to set coefficients exactly to zero
Useful in some contexts due to its tendency to prefer solution with fewer non-zero coefficients
	Effectively reducing the number of features upon which the given solution is dependent
Fundamental to the field of compressed sensing

It is super similar to Ridge Regression ([[Ridge Regression and Ridge Classification]]), but has a different $\alpha$ term
