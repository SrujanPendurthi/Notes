# Definitions
**Mathematical Statement** is a declarative sentence or string of sentences that can be definitively classified as either `True` or `False`, meaning it possesses a determinable truth value
	AKA **Proposition**
	Can this statement regarding math have a boolean value `True` or `False` ?
	*Example: 1+1=2*

**Theorem** is an important result
	*Example: Pythagorean Theorem*

**Corollary** is a result that follows from a theorem with little extra work
	*Example: applying a general theorem to a special case*

**Lemma** is a smaller result that is useful in proving more significant results later

**Proposition** is a general term that can apply to any result. It is often used for results that are not substantial enough to be called theorems

**Definitions** fix the exact meaning of a term so that everyone is using it consistently.
	*Example: A triangle is called isosceles if and only if two of its sides have equal length*

"If and only If" is frequently abbreviated as "iff" and indicates the statement is biconditional
	Meaning that the statement must be true both ways for the statement to be `True`
	All definitions are biconditional

**Conjectures** are claims that are believed to be `True` but have yet to be proven
# Proofs

A **Proof** is a logical argument that establishes the truth of a mathematical statement beyond any doubt

**Important Criteria for Proofs**
	*Precision*: Every statement should be `True` and unambiguous
	*Logic*: Each step must follow from previous steps with proper motivation and explanation
	*Organization*: The argument should proceed in a clear order, starting from assumptions and ending with the desired result
	*Clarity*: Steps should be connected with enough explanation for the reader to follow
