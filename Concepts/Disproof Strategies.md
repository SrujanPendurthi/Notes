To prove a statement is false, we can prove the negation of the statement  

Prove $\neg q$

Proof by **CounterExample**(for universal statements $\forall$)
	Recall that  $\neg(\forall x \in X, p(x)) \equiv \exists x \in X, \neg p(x)$ 
	So to disprove a logical formula of the form $\forall x \in X,p(x)$ it suffices to find an element of $x$ for which p(x) is false
	Basically, find an element of $X$ where $p(x)$ does not hold
