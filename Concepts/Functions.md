A <b>function</b>, $f$, from $A$ to $B$(denoted $f:A\to B$) is a binary relation from $A$ to $B$ satisfying, where $A$ is the domain and $B$ is the codomain:
	$\forall a \in A, \exists ! b \in B, (a,b) \in f$
	$f(a) =b$
		$f(a)$ is the image of $a$ 

Let $U \subseteq A$ be a subset.
The image of $U$ under $f$ is $f[U] = \{f(x)| x \in U\}$
The image of $A$ under $f$ is called the <b>image/range</b> of $f$

Let $f: A \to B$ be a function
Let $b \in B$. Any element $a \in A$ satisfying $f(a) =b$ is called a <b>preimage</b> of b
Let $V \subseteq B$.Then the preimage of $V$ is $f^{-1}[v] = \{a \in A| f(a) \in V\}$
