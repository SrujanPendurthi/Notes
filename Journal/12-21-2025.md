I came back home past 2am this morning. I had to drive home after taking more than 5mg of marijuana through an edible. Although it was enjoyable, I did not have fun. At the time, it was quite enjoyable, but I do not remember everything. Anything that I remember is fuzzy. I feel strange even into the night. 

I started using Obsidian today and I am super stocked to get back into learning. I have been reading *Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss* recently. It has been a good read. 

I am grateful for my father, my T480 laptop, my Ubuntu server Laptop, firearms, and land. I really want to start my own endeavor, make a lot of money, then buy a large tract of land in Wyoming. I need to loose weight, but I have been indulging in sweets too much.
