A vector space is <b>finite-dimensional</b> if it's the span of a finite list of vectors

<u>Theorem 11.2</u>
Let $V$ be a vector space. If a list of vectors spans $V$, then it contains a basis of $V$

<u>Theorem 11.3</u>
Every finite-dimensional vector space has a basis.

<u>Theorem 11.4</u>
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space. If a list of vectors in $V$ is linearly independent, it can be extended to a basis of $V$

All bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of vectors. The <b>dimension</b> of a vector space $V$ is the number of vectors in any basis of $V$ denoted $dim(V)$

<u>Theorem 11.6: Proving that a List of Vectors is a Basis</u>
The vectors $v_1,...,v_n \in V$ form a basis of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ if they have two of the following three properties:
	The vectors $v_1,...,v_n$ are linearly independent
	$span(v_1,...,v_n)$ is the entire vector space $V$
	The number of vectors $n$ is equal to $dim(V)$
If two of the properties are True, then the third is automatically True by definition of basis.
