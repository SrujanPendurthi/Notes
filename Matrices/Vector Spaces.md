A real **vector space** is a set $V$ with operations of addition and scalar multiplication with the following conditions:
	$V$ contains the additive identity 0
	$V$ is closed under scalar multiplication if $v \in V$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, then $cv \in V$
	$V$ is closed under addition if $v,w \in V$, then $v + w \in V$

A **subset** of set $A$ is a set whose elements are all elements of $A$
A **subspace** $W$ of a vector space is a subset of the vector space $V$ and $W$ must be a vector space

The **Intersection**, $A \cup B$, of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all elements in both $A$ and $B$. If $W_1$ and $W_2$ are subspaces of a vector space $V$, then $W_1 \cup W_2$ is also a subspace of $V$
