# Elementary Row Operations
There are three *Elementary Row Operations* that we can do to a $Ax=b$ matrix that will not cause a loss in information:
	Multiplying a row by a scalar
		Multiplying by 0 will cause a loss of information
	Adding a multiple of a row to another row 
	Swapping Rows

These operations are very similar to the operations in [Vector Operations](Introduction and Vector Operations)
# Gaussian Elimination
The goal of *Gaussian Elimination* is to convert a matrix into [RREF](Linear Systems)
The entire process of Gaussian Elimination is using the elementary row operations column-by-column in order to make pivots, ultimately make the $Ax=b$ matrix into RREF
